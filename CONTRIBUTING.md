## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We appreciate any help you can offer, and there are many ways to
contribute.

## Branching strategy

We chose to do GitHub Flow for several reasons:

- we think that Git Flow was forcing us to create too many branches, which we didn't like
- we wanted the working version of our code to be on the main branch, which eliminated the Gitlab Flow strategy

So GitHub Flow was the branching strategy that suited us best.

## Code Contributions

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Knowledge of the language and tools used in the project (java, maven)

### Process

- Fork the repository (git clone link)
- Create a new branch for your changes (git branch name)
- Make your changes
- Run any tests or checks (if applicable)
- Commit your changes and push to your fork
- Create a new pull request on GitHub

### How to run tests

Before starting, check that you have a java 17 jdk at least, and maven on your machine. Then, :

- Open a terminal in the project directory
- Execute the command "mvn test"

## Non-Code Contributions

There are many ways to contribute to a project beyond writing code. These include:

- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting new features
- Translating documentation
- Writing or editing documentation
- Providing design assets (e.g. graphics, logos)
